# Overview
- [sonyc_mkii_tools](https://github.com/sonyc-project/SONYC-MKII/tree/main/sonyc_mkii_tools): A narrowly focused piece of software that sits on the USB-serial link. We often use it for debugging but practically it only exists to de-mux and decode the bitstream and hand off data to higher level services. It can also interface with the bootloader to reprogram motes.
